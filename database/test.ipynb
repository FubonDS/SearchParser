Palm Heights project at TP. German heads - Photo: Top of Data from Batdongsan. com. And yet, real estate prices in big cities, especially apartments, over the last five years, have had a significant increase. In particular, in Hanoi, the cost of a condo in the Haomes Smart City project in Long biên and Times City District has increased by 2,850 and 127 percent after five years. In TPHCM, the increase in projects has been considered to be “older than in Hanoi. One of the projects in the central area, Hado Russa Garden (0.10), noted the cost of apartments rising nearly 48 percent after five years; Alexomes Central Park, which is off the edge of the T.C.A. County, increased nearly 53 percent; further from the center of the city, the cost of apartments at Palm Heights project in TP. German heads also have nearly 53% increase. Looking at the increase, some people say, buy real estate before the market goes up, beyond what the buyer can afford. According to expert Ding Shikun, the housing market in Vietnam has been going through 30 years from locality, incomplete laws, and even if it does not encourage land investments, so far so far, that investors can “get as far off as the TPHCM people buy land in DaVA, the people who buy their land. Second, the state is moving more and more real estate into the market economy, through the issue of extended laws, allowing people to own real estate. So now, real estate is a market economy, not a special industry, which is represented by two very severe recessions. The first is 2010-2011. At that time, many businesses failed, and some banks also went bankrupt. By 2022, many banks and businesses had difficulty. This shows that the Vietnam real estate market, although unique, is still operating according to the common rules of the global market. He shows that there's no real-estate market purchases just for words, there's only increases, but it's not down, because it's not the market economy. “ The market economy doesn’t always go up. Instead, once the rise is too fast, there'll be bubbles and closes. The world has been and there are many grisly bubbles - protagonists. With the growing expansion of the Vietnamese real estate market, which is more and more market economic, the question is why the current real estate market is so depressed, it's very difficult for real estate prices to keep going up? If, according to market economic laws, when an investment product increases prices, it shows a lot of demand and is willing to buy; but why is it that the buyers don't get it or it's very difficult to sell, the bank goes on forever? If the real estate market is increasing and continues to increase, proving that the market is so productive, the businesses in the business have no worries about paying their debts, no need for the State to rescue them. “ The real - estate market doesn’t go up as hot as the rumors about how many news media reports are that the buyers are not buying, that they can’t buy at present, that he can’t buy them, that they are small cases, whereas the real estate market is very broad, such as TPHCM or Hanoi. Regarding the story of whether to buy real estate now, Mr. Clear, if the investor is not a very wealthy person, there is a need for closer observation, especially if he should not rush at hot spots such as East Britain or TP. German heads (TPHCM) at a price of 100 million dollars per m2. “ An investor should buy it only when the market is afraid, when the price is low, but not because the price is high and the price is high, especially in a situation that is not as obvious as it is today. He pointed out that if a buyer buys a house to live in, he needs to ask why it is necessary to buy large projects far away, and the price can be up to 70 to 80 million per meter or more. Get an application for the TPHCM districts, the U.S.P.P.P.P.P.P.D., where there's a lot of good housing, comfortable, exciting housing, because it's right at the center; some of the top apartments are being sold at about 70 meters. Five and a half billion dollars at the top of the line, which is over 65 million per meter. Besides the price, the buyer can completely check, evaluate before deciding whether to lower the money, such as observing good management, good habitats, whether to rent it back. So why is it that when the buyers go into new projects, when they hear the real estate information that's scarce, it's not hard to search the Internet for information about many apartments that are being sold at a reasonable price, most apartments now only work for five to seven years and have a good position? These things just show up at the housing market, not to mention other markets like alleys and surrounding land, which show that real estate markets don't heat up like rumors. True buyers can freely find a place with a reasonable price, a discerning expert. On the other hand, during the rising market periods, the majority had the appearance of surfers. Some statistics: up to 70 percent of the investors now have the primary purpose of surfing. Thus, the number of people who really buy to stay is not much. There's not much to worry about. There's a raise in demand. The next surfer won't be able to buy and sell for a few months, so he won't worry about the surfers getting their hands down. Unable to take its own case, the special apartment to talk about market-wide prices, as he shows it, is coming up, Vietnam is coming up, real estate markets are getting bigger and bigger, government policy is getting clearer. Then the real estate market will be like the developed world, becoming the market economy. So there's no higher price than being able to exploit real estate or income. As the countries grow, that's what Vietnam will be like. The value of real estate has come to an end. Can't take personal cases, a special apartment that offers price in the sky to talk about the market economy. Markets in developed cities like New York, Hong Kong, Singapore, Shanghai... all have apartments at a rate of tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars, but that's not why taking those apartments is typical of these cities, because they're unique apartments for super rich people. And the general market of countries has to be based on the income of the people and the level of mining. Neither will Vietnam, nor will housing prices go up regardless of these two factors, he has the evaluation. About the lack of resources, it's easy to find on the Internet information that's selling the second-grade real estate from the street, the infrastructure, the apartment... a lot of it. Besides, just getting out of the city, with every mile out of the city, there's as much open ground as there's open ground, as in the Argentine, the Main Chief, the Republic, the River, the Need for Juju... that shows that there's no shortage of land to build real estate, which leads to a lack of supply.

In order to be transparent, we need to connect with the public record system, the taxes, the bank. In the planning of the Prime Minister\\'s request for price-adjustment, real estate capital, and social drive, the Building Department says that, in the second quarter, it will coordinate with Justice, Finance, Resource and Environment to study the stock trade model in exchange for land procedures. People can trade real estate, notary, tax, and register trades in electronic environments. At the same time, research proposes a pilot project that models the real estate exchange center and the rights to use land run by the State to do research in the II/2025 quarter to increase public, transparency for the market. In order to do these things, experts say, real estate transactions are much more complex than shared stock with journalists, Mr. Lightman, CEO of Financial Sciences, University of Arboring, or, in principle, real estate transactions can be digital, but they can\\'t operate in a stock-like way. The reason Hu put it up, real estate transactions have more specifics, such as high trading values, legal, planning, value and finance than stock. “ Low amounts are due to a long - term transfer of real estate, involving various agencies. Every real estate has its own character, cannot standardize and trade mass like stock. The current legal treatment has not yet been authorized to trade completely on a digital basis without direct confirmation from the public authorities, taxes, environmental resources. The market psychology is afraid, especially with the property trade as large as the property, the buyer still wants to check the facts before the transpo transaction, Mr. Huy. According to experts, setting up a center of real estate transactions if not strictly controlled, there may still be “a price price, a head. Photo: According to experts, there are a lot of barriers and risks in developing online real estate transactions. It\\'s a legal risk when the existing law is not in sync, and it\\'s easy to develop a conflict if it doesn\\'t correct accordingly. “ Security risk, hackers can attack, fake transactions, steal information. The risk of cheating and manipulating the market. If not well - controlled, it may appear that “the price of the head can be used for“ the price of the head, ” or “the price of the head, ” or “the price of the head. ” Highly developed costs of high-investigating technology, lowering data, human rights training. The difficulty with the value of each property has its own character, cannot be evaluated automatically as a stock. In particular, it takes a combination of management agencies; if the data doesn\\'t communicate, the transaction process is slow, it doesn\\'t work, Mr. DEA. It is difficult to fight tax returns, “Is it not possible to establish a housing exchange center on an electronic environment when there is only an Internet network? Now, we\\'re missing information, data, security mechanisms... Samha Shun, director of the Institute of Resources and Environmentals, shared our views. According to Shun, setting up a center of real estate transactions in an electronic environment that only manages statistics, the position of the province is “the price of government; and trading to fight tax failure, fighting“ the price of the U.S.R. will be very difficult. However, the chief said, if you do it, you should do it in Hanoi and TPHCM first because these two cities have a huge amount of real estate transactions. If you want to test it, you also have to link the public\\'s office to the land registration office and the corporate brokering center to see what the cost of the trade is through the center, and that\\'s when you know if you have a head or not. Meanwhile, Mr. Lightman notices that in order to deliver real estate transactions to a successful digital environment, we need to ensure synchronization of technology, legal and financial ecosystems. Standardized land data across the country, built the electronic land management system. Along with that, establish an official electronic property exchange, connected to a publicized system, taxes, banks. Complete the legal corridor, acknowledge the legal value of the electronic contract, the signature. The blockchain application for storing property information, avoiding fraud, falsifying papers. Besides, we have to develop online payment systems and sign safe funds, merge with banks to support digital mortgages. “ The digital real estate epidemic is a vital trend. However, Vietnam needed a proper development strategy, making sure that technology, legal, and local markets were properly developed.

       "  'content': \"The LDR increases and pressure on the bank's bank system. The strategy of expanding credit faster than the campaign has helped the bank to maximize their profits over the years. As the LDRs continue to increase, however, the risk of liquidity is also increasing, especially in the context of interest swings and competition in increasingly intense campaigns. Trusts have gone higher than data campaigns from OttawastockFinance, which says, between December 31 and 2024, the total debt at 27 banks in the system is greater than 11. 85 million dollars, 18 percent higher than the beginning of the year. HDBK (BBBB) is the most powerful trust bank (+29%), followed by NCB (NVB,+29%), MB (MBB, +27%), VPB,+22%), and TPB (TPB,+22%)... loaning clients and paying clients up to 31/2024/2024 (U.S.) $14 million, up by 13% by the beginning of the year. Except for ABBK (ABBK) dropping by 9%, the rest of the banks are growing. MB is the most powerful deposit (+26%) bank, then NCB (+240), PGB (PGB, +21), LPB (LPB,+19%), and HDB (8). The potential pressure on the credit bar increases 18 percent while mobilizing 13 percent shows a high LDR rate (Loan to Deposit Ratio). At the end of 2024, there were 20/27 banks that had higher LDR rates than at the beginning of the year, which meant that the credit banks were spending more than their resources. By December 31, 2024, there are 9/27 banks with LDR rates below 85 percent. There are four banks that put this rate above 100%, including VPB. 37%), VIB (108. 165) SeABank (SSB, 105. 33%) and MSB (101. 4%). Bank LDR rates are up to 31 December 2024 Sources: OEstockFinance Rate in recent years, which have also tended to increase, reflecting greater credit extensions than capital impulse speeds in recent years. This is a popular strategy, where banks want to take advantage of the opportunity to increase their debt to maximize their profit. However, this disparity shows that banks are focused on pushing loans and also facing bars challenges, especially in the changing interest rates and increasing economic risk. IN THE year 2024, UNICEF has developed monetary policies that promote credit growth, especially after the first two months of negative growth. GIVING the money policy, it stimulates credit growth to support business and economy. Real estate, manufacturing, importing, consumption, all have high capital demands. In addition, last year, the pressure for competition in capital campaigns increased as the cost of campaigning fell to the early stage of the year, causing the donor to shift his investment to stock, real estate, gold rather than savings. The competition between banks prevents mobilization from keeping up with credit growth. Another cause of increased LDR rates, creating potential pressure on the bank bars is the optimal strategy for using capital at some banks. Some banks promote retail loans, SME, and real estate to optimize revenues (NIM); make good use of unpaid funds (possessed checks, bank loans, international loans) to expand their debt without completely relying on their clients. As the LDR increases, if the motors don't catch up, the risk of liquidity increases, especially in the changing environment and the money flow off the banking system. High LDR banks will need to increase capital mobilization to secure the liquidity and maintain their credit ratings. In the face of increasing pressure, VIS Rating points out that small banks are facing high levels of risk, because they depend on their short-term capital and have their weaknesses; they need flexible strategies to stay active. Small banks can release second-level bonds to increase their long-term capital, reducing the stress of short-term motivation. Also, it is possible to focus on lower - risk loans, such as spending and small businesses, rather than putting too much capital into real - estate. Some small banks may look up strategic partners or proceed to improve financial abilities, expand market parts, and reduce liquid pressure. According to VIS Rating, the liquid pressure continued to be a huge challenge to the small bank in 2025. If we don't have time to adjust our business model and optimize our credit ratings, the risk of losing credit can become a serious problem. In addition to the LDR rate, the CEO of Financial Sciences, Bank University, says, the bank also needs to monitor some additional numbers to evaluate the liquidity. If short-term capital rates are too high, the bank is prone to short-term weight loss. As the CASA goes down, the bank's going to have to increase long-term mobilization with higher capital costs. If the deposits (GUI, Government Bonds, NHP) are down dramatically, the bars will be greatly affected. Or the rising interest rate in the bank also reflects the stress of the liquidity in the system. If the bank's banking system is tightened, banks will be forced to increase their motor interest rates in order to attract deposits; loans can also increase, making business and private costs higher, thus suppressing the demand for money and economic growth. Thus, interventions can be used to support bars such as open markets (OMO), resupply, or reduce required reserves to support the banking system. If there is increased risk in liquidity, IT can be controlled by adjusting the LDR ceiling or by restricting the flow of capital into high - risk areas such as real estate. According to Commander, if LDR trends continue to rise, capital costs will increase, NIM is narrowed down, affecting long-term banking efficiency. Banks need to increase their funds, especially CASA, to reduce capital costs; control appropriate credit growth, avoid expanding their debt too quickly without being able to keep up with it. At the same time, it is wise to diversify your funds, use your bonds, international loans to support your liquidity; carefully monitor your liquid risk, and ensure that you adhere to your financial and LDR safety regulations. A faster credit extension strategy has helped the bank maximize their profits over the years. As the LDRs continue to increase, however, the risk of liquidity is also increasing, especially in the context of interest swings and competition in increasingly intense campaigns. Banks need to increase their liquid management, risk control, to avoid the negative impact on their profits and the stability of their long - term financial system. It's Lam Fresnel.\",\n",

Two million people, high urbanization rate. However, over the past few years of development, the real estate market has not been compatible with the status of other central cities, other nuclear cities. According to the Vietnamese Realm Society (VRRS), during the pre - 2015 period, the DNC market had not been diverse, and land transactions were mainly on sale products. In 2015, while the SDA market in other central cities had developed over many periods, “the D.N.U.S. market began to be better shaped by some hotel projects, the shopping malls, the neighborhoods, relocation of the real estate business. is deployed. Due to the limited number of projects developed, the main scale is in the form of small populations, the progress is slow, the needs of the market are not yet high because of the low income of the population. The market needs poetry to maintain growth, but it's stable at a low level. In 2023, the city's GDDP value needed to reach nearly 119. Three trillion, ten times. Twice as much as 2004 and triple. Eight so many in 2010. In 2024, GRDP rose 7. 12%, highest level in the last six years (except 2022) due to post-suppression. The scale of the economy is near 133. One trillion dollars, up by 11. 5% compared to the same 2023 period, the same weight of 9. 4% for the Plains of the Nine Dragons. The economy is moving to industrial, construction and services that are 84 percent. Business and public income have improved; state budgets, retail revenues, and two-digit growth services. The 2021-2030 Forms, vision until 2050 made it a point for the need for poetry to thrive in industrial areas (KCN). Planning until 2030, it's going to create seven new industrial sites, more than 6,485ha, more than six. Five times over the current area, which is particularly motivating for the NDA market in general, the industrial RlS segment in particular in the developed need. In comparison with other central cities, the number of KNNA’s established remains very low, attracted to FDI in “tops below M.R.S., according to V.R.S.R.S. The next development of KNCs not only provides incentives for economic growth but also attracts FDI, bringing large amounts of housing needs from the labor team in KNC, especially the need to go home to the advanced housing of experts, managers working in the KNA. It also notes some serious traffic sublevel projects, the highways are already in progress. Traffic networks shorten the time travel between locals. VRS takes note of some positive developments in the DlS market. In 2024, there were two. Three thousand open housing products, up to 80 percent more than they were last year. The supply increases, puts the amount of transactions on a quarterly land, more than a thousand trades made on the primary market in 2024, almost five times as much as the previous year. The consumption rate on the new supply reached 43 percent, a 24-point increase in 2023. The apartment is kind of the supply and the liquidity of the need for poetry, 50 percent of the supply and 73 percent of the transactions across the market. Even though the supply of apartments that opened in 2024 on land increased five times over the previous year, it was still very low in comparison with other central cities, mostly contributed by the social housing project. The substantiating of the high-end apartment is scarce for only one project to be deployed, which is going to cost 1/2 to two-thirds of the cost of selling the same quality projects as the other big city. VIRS tells us that investors actively raise prices after each sale from 4.5 percent. The sub-prime bar tends to increase slightly, especially the ground product, the individual housing, the clean legal, has a ledger, under two billion dollars per dollar, the price of the trade goes up from five to seven percent over the year's head. The World Trade Market has the potential for growth by means of economic growth, traffic infrastructure, planning, and VRS. In the new cycle, with the goal of sustainable development, it's an advantage to be in a relatively stable state, not to experience a lot of fever like the rest of the world. To reach out and catch up with the high - central cities, it takes a cutting - edge step, without being “slow. Caring, growing up in sync with the underlying elements of traffic infrastructure, society, economics, travel is the key to right and safe marketing. Chi Minh Fünster.\",\n",

Palm Heights project at TP. German heads - Photo: Top of Data from Batdongsan. com. And yet, real estate prices in big cities, especially apartments, over the last five years, have had a significant increase. In particular, in Hanoi, the cost of a condo in the Haomes Smart City project in Long biên and Times City District has increased by 2,850 and 127 percent after five years. In TPHCM, the increase in projects has been considered to be “older than in Hanoi. One of the projects in the central area, Hado Russa Garden (0.10), noted the cost of apartments rising nearly 48 percent after five years; Alexomes Central Park, which is off the edge of the T.C.A. County, increased nearly 53 percent; further from the center of the city, the cost of apartments at Palm Heights project in TP. German heads also have nearly 53% increase. Looking at the increase, some people say, buy real estate before the market goes up, beyond what the buyer can afford. According to expert Ding Shikun, the housing market in Vietnam has been going through 30 years from locality, incomplete laws, and even if it does not encourage land investments, so far so far, that investors can “get as far off as the TPHCM people buy land in DaVA, the people who buy their land. Second, the state is moving more and more real estate into the market economy, through the issue of extended laws, allowing people to own real estate. So now, real estate is a market economy, not a special industry, which is represented by two very severe recessions. The first is 2010-2011. At that time, many businesses failed, and some banks also went bankrupt. By 2022, many banks and businesses had difficulty. This shows that the Vietnam real estate market, although unique, is still operating according to the common rules of the global market. He shows that there's no real-estate market purchases just for words, there's only increases, but it's not down, because it's not the market economy. “ The market economy doesn’t always go up. Instead, once the rise is too fast, there'll be bubbles and closes. The world has been and there are many grisly bubbles - protagonists. With the growing expansion of the Vietnamese real estate market, which is more and more market economic, the question is why the current real estate market is so depressed, it's very difficult for real estate prices to keep going up? If, according to market economic laws, when an investment product increases prices, it shows a lot of demand and is willing to buy; but why is it that the buyers don't get it or it's very difficult to sell, the bank goes on forever? If the real estate market is increasing and continues to increase, proving that the market is so productive, the businesses in the business have no worries about paying their debts, no need for the State to rescue them. “ The real - estate market doesn’t go up as hot as the rumors about how many news media reports are that the buyers are not buying, that they can’t buy at present, that he can’t buy them, that they are small cases, whereas the real estate market is very broad, such as TPHCM or Hanoi. Regarding the story of whether to buy real estate now, Mr. Clear, if the investor is not a very wealthy person, there is a need for closer observation, especially if he should not rush at hot spots such as East Britain or TP. German heads (TPHCM) at a price of 100 million dollars per m2. “ An investor should buy it only when the market is afraid, when the price is low, but not because the price is high and the price is high, especially in a situation that is not as obvious as it is today. He pointed out that if a buyer buys a house to live in, he needs to ask why it is necessary to buy large projects far away, and the price can be up to 70 to 80 million per meter or more. Get an application for the TPHCM districts, the U.S.P.P.P.P.P.P.D., where there's a lot of good housing, comfortable, exciting housing, because it's right at the center; some of the top apartments are being sold at about 70 meters. Five and a half billion dollars at the top of the line, which is over 65 million per meter. Besides the price, the buyer can completely check, evaluate before deciding whether to lower the money, such as observing good management, good habitats, whether to rent it back. So why is it that when the buyers go into new projects, when they hear the real estate information that's scarce, it's not hard to search the Internet for information about many apartments that are being sold at a reasonable price, most apartments now only work for five to seven years and have a good position? These things just show up at the housing market, not to mention other markets like alleys and surrounding land, which show that real estate markets don't heat up like rumors. True buyers can freely find a place with a reasonable price, a discerning expert. On the other hand, during the rising market periods, the majority had the appearance of surfers. Some statistics: up to 70 percent of the investors now have the primary purpose of surfing. Thus, the number of people who really buy to stay is not much. There's not much to worry about. There's a raise in demand. The next surfer won't be able to buy and sell for a few months, so he won't worry about the surfers getting their hands down. Unable to take its own case, the special apartment to talk about market-wide prices, as he shows it, is coming up, Vietnam is coming up, real estate markets are getting bigger and bigger, government policy is getting clearer. Then the real estate market will be like the developed world, becoming the market economy. So there's no higher price than being able to exploit real estate or income. As the countries grow, that's what Vietnam will be like. The value of real estate has come to an end. Can't take personal cases, a special apartment that offers price in the sky to talk about the market economy. Markets in developed cities like New York, Hong Kong, Singapore, Shanghai... all have apartments at a rate of tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars, but that's not why taking those apartments is typical of these cities, because they're unique apartments for super rich people. And the general market of countries has to be based on the income of the people and the level of mining. Neither will Vietnam, nor will housing prices go up regardless of these two factors, he has the evaluation. About the lack of resources, it's easy to find on the Internet information that's selling the second-grade real estate from the street, the infrastructure, the apartment... a lot of it. Besides, just getting out of the city, with every mile out of the city, there's as much open ground as there's open ground, as in the Argentine, the Main Chief, the Republic, the River, the Need for Juju... that shows that there's no shortage of land to build real estate, which leads to a lack of supply.

In order to be transparent, we need to connect with the public record system, the taxes, the bank. In the planning of the Prime Minister\\'s request for price-adjustment, real estate capital, and social drive, the Building Department says that, in the second quarter, it will coordinate with Justice, Finance, Resource and Environment to study the stock trade model in exchange for land procedures. People can trade real estate, notary, tax, and register trades in electronic environments. At the same time, research proposes a pilot project that models the real estate exchange center and the rights to use land run by the State to do research in the II/2025 quarter to increase public, transparency for the market. In order to do these things, experts say, real estate transactions are much more complex than shared stock with journalists, Mr. Lightman, CEO of Financial Sciences, University of Arboring, or, in principle, real estate transactions can be digital, but they can\\'t operate in a stock-like way. The reason Hu put it up, real estate transactions have more specifics, such as high trading values, legal, planning, value and finance than stock. “ Low amounts are due to a long - term transfer of real estate, involving various agencies. Every real estate has its own character, cannot standardize and trade mass like stock. The current legal treatment has not yet been authorized to trade completely on a digital basis without direct confirmation from the public authorities, taxes, environmental resources. The market psychology is afraid, especially with the property trade as large as the property, the buyer still wants to check the facts before the transpo transaction, Mr. Huy. According to experts, setting up a center of real estate transactions if not strictly controlled, there may still be “a price price, a head. Photo: According to experts, there are a lot of barriers and risks in developing online real estate transactions. It\\'s a legal risk when the existing law is not in sync, and it\\'s easy to develop a conflict if it doesn\\'t correct accordingly. “ Security risk, hackers can attack, fake transactions, steal information. The risk of cheating and manipulating the market. If not well - controlled, it may appear that “the price of the head can be used for“ the price of the head, ” or “the price of the head, ” or “the price of the head. ” Highly developed costs of high-investigating technology, lowering data, human rights training. The difficulty with the value of each property has its own character, cannot be evaluated automatically as a stock. In particular, it takes a combination of management agencies; if the data doesn\\'t communicate, the transaction process is slow, it doesn\\'t work, Mr. DEA. It is difficult to fight tax returns, “Is it not possible to establish a housing exchange center on an electronic environment when there is only an Internet network? Now, we\\'re missing information, data, security mechanisms... Samha Shun, director of the Institute of Resources and Environmentals, shared our views. According to Shun, setting up a center of real estate transactions in an electronic environment that only manages statistics, the position of the province is “the price of government; and trading to fight tax failure, fighting“ the price of the U.S.R. will be very difficult. However, the chief said, if you do it, you should do it in Hanoi and TPHCM first because these two cities have a huge amount of real estate transactions. If you want to test it, you also have to link the public\\'s office to the land registration office and the corporate brokering center to see what the cost of the trade is through the center, and that\\'s when you know if you have a head or not. Meanwhile, Mr. Lightman notices that in order to deliver real estate transactions to a successful digital environment, we need to ensure synchronization of technology, legal and financial ecosystems. Standardized land data across the country, built the electronic land management system. Along with that, establish an official electronic property exchange, connected to a publicized system, taxes, banks. Complete the legal corridor, acknowledge the legal value of the electronic contract, the signature. The blockchain application for storing property information, avoiding fraud, falsifying papers. Besides, we have to develop online payment systems and sign safe funds, merge with banks to support digital mortgages. “ The digital real estate epidemic is a vital trend. However, Vietnam needed a proper development strategy, making sure that technology, legal, and local markets were properly developed. Need to learn from successful models of countries like Estonia, Dubai and avoid the mistakes of failing markets,\" warned Commander. According to this expert, there has to be a test phase, possibly a test point in Hanoi, TPHCM before expanding. Invest in security technology, blockchain app, AI to secure trade. At the same time, build a legal corridor, create trust for the people. \"If we make the right route, our model of real estate transactions in the digital environment can help to increase transparency, reduce risk, and stimulate terms for the Vietnam real estate market in the future, Mr. Halley will share more.

       "  'content': \"The LDR increases and pressure on the bank's bank system. The strategy of expanding credit faster than the campaign has helped the bank to maximize their profits over the years. As the LDRs continue to increase, however, the risk of liquidity is also increasing, especially in the context of interest swings and competition in increasingly intense campaigns. Trusts have gone higher than data campaigns from OttawastockFinance, which says, between December 31 and 2024, the total debt at 27 banks in the system is greater than 11. 85 million dollars, 18 percent higher than the beginning of the year. HDBK (BBBB) is the most powerful trust bank (+29%), followed by NCB (NVB,+29%), MB (MBB, +27%), VPB,+22%), and TPB (TPB,+22%)... loaning clients and paying clients up to 31/2024/2024 (U.S.) $14 million, up by 13% by the beginning of the year. Except for ABBK (ABBK) dropping by 9%, the rest of the banks are growing. MB is the most powerful deposit (+26%) bank, then NCB (+240), PGB (PGB, +21), LPB (LPB,+19%), and HDB (8). The potential pressure on the credit bar increases 18 percent while mobilizing 13 percent shows a high LDR rate (Loan to Deposit Ratio). At the end of 2024, there were 20/27 banks that had higher LDR rates than at the beginning of the year, which meant that the credit banks were spending more than their resources. By December 31, 2024, there are 9/27 banks with LDR rates below 85 percent. There are four banks that put this rate above 100%, including VPB. 37%), VIB (108. 165) SeABank (SSB, 105. 33%) and MSB (101. 4%). Bank LDR rates are up to 31 December 2024 Sources: OEstockFinance Rate in recent years, which have also tended to increase, reflecting greater credit extensions than capital impulse speeds in recent years. This is a popular strategy, where banks want to take advantage of the opportunity to increase their debt to maximize their profit. However, this disparity shows that banks are focused on pushing loans and also facing bars challenges, especially in the changing interest rates and increasing economic risk. IN THE year 2024, UNICEF has developed monetary policies that promote credit growth, especially after the first two months of negative growth. GIVING the money policy, it stimulates credit growth to support business and economy. Real estate, manufacturing, importing, consumption, all have high capital demands. In addition, last year, the pressure for competition in capital campaigns increased as the cost of campaigning fell to the early stage of the year, causing the donor to shift his investment to stock, real estate, gold rather than savings. The competition between banks prevents mobilization from keeping up with credit growth. Another cause of increased LDR rates, creating potential pressure on the bank bars is the optimal strategy for using capital at some banks. Some banks promote retail loans, SME, and real estate to optimize revenues (NIM); make good use of unpaid funds (possessed checks, bank loans, international loans) to expand their debt without completely relying on their clients. As the LDR increases, if the motors don't catch up, the risk of liquidity increases, especially in the changing environment and the money flow off the banking system. High LDR banks will need to increase capital mobilization to secure the liquidity and maintain their credit ratings. In the face of increasing pressure, VIS Rating points out that small banks are facing high levels of risk, because they depend on their short-term capital and have their weaknesses; they need flexible strategies to stay active. Small banks can release second-level bonds to increase their long-term capital, reducing the stress of short-term motivation. Also, it is possible to focus on lower - risk loans, such as spending and small businesses, rather than putting too much capital into real - estate. Some small banks may look up strategic partners or proceed to improve financial abilities, expand market parts, and reduce liquid pressure. According to VIS Rating, the liquid pressure continued to be a huge challenge to the small bank in 2025. If we don't have time to adjust our business model and optimize our credit ratings, the risk of losing credit can become a serious problem. In addition to the LDR rate, the CEO of Financial Sciences, Bank University, says, the bank also needs to monitor some additional numbers to evaluate the liquidity. If short-term capital rates are too high, the bank is prone to short-term weight loss. As the CASA goes down, the bank's going to have to increase long-term mobilization with higher capital costs. If the deposits (GUI, Government Bonds, NHP) are down dramatically, the bars will be greatly affected. Or the rising interest rate in the bank also reflects the stress of the liquidity in the system. If the bank's banking system is tightened, banks will be forced to increase their motor interest rates in order to attract deposits; loans can also increase, making business and private costs higher, thus suppressing the demand for money and economic growth. Thus, interventions can be used to support bars such as open markets (OMO), resupply, or reduce required reserves to support the banking system. If there is increased risk in liquidity, IT can be controlled by adjusting the LDR ceiling or by restricting the flow of capital into high - risk areas such as real estate. According to Commander, if LDR trends continue to rise, capital costs will increase, NIM is narrowed down, affecting long-term banking efficiency. Banks need to increase their funds, especially CASA, to reduce capital costs; control appropriate credit growth, avoid expanding their debt too quickly without being able to keep up with it. At the same time, it is wise to diversify your funds, use your bonds, international loans to support your liquidity; carefully monitor your liquid risk, and ensure that you adhere to your financial and LDR safety regulations. A faster credit extension strategy has helped the bank maximize their profits over the years. As the LDRs continue to increase, however, the risk of liquidity is also increasing, especially in the context of interest swings and competition in increasingly intense campaigns. Banks need to increase their liquid management, risk control, to avoid the negative impact on their profits and the stability of their long - term financial system. It's Lam Fresnel.\",\n",

Two million people, high urbanization rate. However, over the past few years of development, the real estate market has not been compatible with the status of other central cities, other nuclear cities. According to the Vietnamese Realm Society (VRRS), during the pre - 2015 period, the DNC market had not been diverse, and land transactions were mainly on sale products. In 2015, while the SDA market in other central cities had developed over many periods, “the D.N.U.S. market began to be better shaped by some hotel projects, the shopping malls, the neighborhoods, relocation of the real estate business. is deployed. Due to the limited number of projects developed, the main scale is in the form of small populations, the progress is slow, the needs of the market are not yet high because of the low income of the population. The market needs poetry to maintain growth, but it's stable at a low level. In 2023, the city's GDDP value needed to reach nearly 119. Three trillion, ten times. Twice as much as 2004 and triple. Eight so many in 2010. In 2024, GRDP rose 7. 12%, highest level in the last six years (except 2022) due to post-suppression. The scale of the economy is near 133. One trillion dollars, up by 11. 5% compared to the same 2023 period, the same weight of 9. 4% for the Plains of the Nine Dragons. The economy is moving to industrial, construction and services that are 84 percent. Business and public income have improved; state budgets, retail revenues, and two-digit growth services. The 2021-2030 Forms, vision until 2050 made it a point for the need for poetry to thrive in industrial areas (KCN). Planning until 2030, it's going to create seven new industrial sites, more than 6,485ha, more than six. Five times over the current area, which is particularly motivating for the NDA market in general, the industrial RlS segment in particular in the developed need. In comparison with other central cities, the number of KNNA’s established remains very low, attracted to FDI in “tops below M.R.S., according to V.R.S.R.S. The next development of KNCs not only provides incentives for economic growth but also attracts FDI, bringing large amounts of housing needs from the labor team in KNC, especially the need to go home to the advanced housing of experts, managers working in the KNA. It also notes some serious traffic sublevel projects, the highways are already in progress. Traffic networks shorten the time travel between locals. VRS takes note of some positive developments in the DlS market. In 2024, there were two. Three thousand open housing products, up to 80 percent more than they were last year. The supply increases, puts the amount of transactions on a quarterly land, more than a thousand trades made on the primary market in 2024, almost five times as much as the previous year. The consumption rate on the new supply reached 43 percent, a 24-point increase in 2023. The apartment is kind of the supply and the liquidity of the need for poetry, 50 percent of the supply and 73 percent of the transactions across the market. Even though the supply of apartments that opened in 2024 on land increased five times over the previous year, it was still very low in comparison with other central cities, mostly contributed by the social housing project.

However, the dream of settling here is a long way off, top income is hard to keep up with. The surveys of Qandme Market Research on February 25 show that home income in TPHCM and Hanoi are superior to other provinces, other cities. The income rate from 40 million to up at TPHCM and Hanoi is four percent, whereas elsewhere, one percent, the rural area is 4.5 percent. The income of 25 million dollars is 45 percent, and in other provinces, 20 percent. And the income goes from 30 million dollars a month to 30 percent, in other provinces of 8%. The income gap between urban and rural areas is enormous. Only 0.7 percent of households in TPHCM and Hanoi have less than 10 million dollars a month than 2.2 percent in rural areas. The data was collected through interviews on a national scale, thus showing a clear disparity that was influenced by the speed of economic growth, job opportunities, and industrial concentration. Hanoi and TPHCM have four percent of their monthly income from 40 million to more. Source: The income painting shows the rich and poor distribution of areas. TPHCM has the highest income, followed by Hanoi and Da Nang. According to surveys, 15,5% of the houses at TPHCM have 35 to 39,9 million dollars a month, compared with 116 in Hanoi and only 1.8 percent in Da Nang. In addition, 5,850 households in TPHCM have income from 40 million to more, while this ratio in Hanoi is 1,8%, and at Da NBA is only 4.5 percent. Although families in TPHCM and Hanoi have the highest income in the country, life is not easy for homes who don't own their homes or are buying their home. The dream of residence and the cost of buying a house was very difficult because housing prices grew at a rapid rate in the last decade. Right now in Hanoi, it's worth about four billion dollars. So the richest household group in Hanoi with 2% of it is worth 40 million dollars a month, if you don't eat anything, it'll take over eight years to buy it. According to Savills, the family income in Hanoi is about 250 million a year. Thus, it took about 16 years for an apartment “to be spread out. Compare the income of three cities. Sources: QM, in fact, costs at TPHCM and Hanoi are much higher than other towns. Let's say the family income is in the highest group and it's 40 million dollars a month. The savings rate may vary depending on the expenses of each family. Let's say that savings are high, let's say 50 percent income, or 20 million dollars a month. It took them almost 17 years to get an apartment. However, that's not counting inflation at high prices and fast housing prices. It's impossible to accumulate money in order to buy a house, realizing a dream of security. The solution is often to borrow and pay. But if you have to borrow a bank, interest will increase the cost of your home and extend the payment of your debt. Time can go back decades if income doesn't break. For the most popular income family group at TPHCM and Hanoi is from 20-24,9 million per month (0.6% of all households), the time accumulates to be able to buy a house or to buy a house will be twice as much as the first group, maybe 40 to 50 years. Compared to rural areas. Sources: QM has a huge income difference between urban and rural areas that are also taking place in many countries in the area and in Asia. In China, although the wealthiest group’s income is higher, real estate prices in large cities, such as Beijing or Shanghai, are far more expensive than TPHCM and Hanoi. Thus, the time for building up houses in these cities can be equal or even longer than Hanoi and TPHCM. As far as the highest income group can be seen, ownership of home in Hanoi and TPHCM has proved to be a major challenge for many households. The difference between the rate of income and the cost of real estate is creating an increasing gap, requiring solutions from both government and market to help people approach their homes more reasonably.

The center connects the three cities of Heracleo to the XL1 bid, which is about two lengths of New York. Four kilometers with three-story design and five bridges. The project is directly linked to six major traffic routes in the east area: Hanoi Highway, Metro 1, 3rd Line, 440 743 A. (D.), 440 743A. In it, the Hanoi Highway (now Wudan Road) plays the role of TP\\'s most important cross - minded axis.

The fact that the New Earth\\'s intersection is at the intersection of the X-axis between the Hanoi Highway and the 3rd region interconnection and the blood glands shows that this is a rare contoural node that assembles both the elements: the inner urban link and the zone link.

The advantage of projects sitting next to intersections and synchronization and flexible connection, the area around the New World intersection is becoming the center of urban development and attracting the interest of the investment world. The projects next to this intersection not only benefit directly from modern transportation systems but also have the potential to increase sustainable value by moving citizens and expanding urban space.

On the other hand, projects along the 3rd floor, but far from the intersection node, have to depend on the branches, make time travel last and reduce its convenientness. Second, the position at the intersection helps projects to benefit from bitter trade activity, especially in the gateway area between the TP. HCM, Pacific and Nai Plain. With high levels of transportation, the projects here have greater commercial potential, which is good for developing retail services, businesses, renting and long-term investments. Meanwhile, far-off projects often have lower commercial skills, due to traffic travel less than the center of traffic. Third, the infrastructure around the New World delivered button is being completed, with a series of utility facilities like the new East Station, the high-tech district, the Aeon Mall, the German University of Majority. This enhances the quality of life and the ability to harness real estate values. Meanwhile, projects far away from the intersections often have to wait a long time for the infrastructure to grow, affecting the potential for increased value. The original project right next to the New Earth\\'s intersection is at the center of the Hanoi Highway and the Third Wind of An\\'s Wind, which is a strategic project next to the New Year\\'s intersection, which is the full advantage of the regional subservation system.

In order to be transparent, we need to connect with the public record system, the taxes, the bank. In the planning of the Prime Minister\\'s request for price-adjustment, real estate capital, and social drive, the Building Department says that, in the second quarter, it will coordinate with Justice, Finance, Resource and Environment to study the stock trade model in exchange for land procedures. People can trade real estate, notary, tax, and register trades in electronic environments. At the same time, research proposes a pilot project that models the real estate exchange center and the rights to use land run by the State to do research in the II/2025 quarter to increase public, transparency for the market. In order to do these things, experts say, real estate transactions are much more complex than shared stock with journalists, Mr. Lightman, CEO of Financial Sciences, University of Arboring, or, in principle, real estate transactions can be digital, but they can\\'t operate in a stock-like way. The reason Hu put it up, real estate transactions have more specifics, such as high trading values, legal, planning, value and finance than stock. “ Low amounts are due to a long - term transfer of real estate, involving various agencies. Every real estate has its own character, cannot standardize and trade mass like stock. The current legal treatment has not yet been authorized to trade completely on a digital basis without direct confirmation from the public authorities, taxes, environmental resources. The market psychology is afraid, especially with the property trade as large as the property, the buyer still wants to check the facts before the transpo transaction, Mr. Huy. According to experts, setting up a center of real estate transactions if not strictly controlled, there may still be “a price price, a head. Photo: According to experts, there are a lot of barriers and risks in developing online real estate transactions. It\\'s a legal risk when the existing law is not in sync, and it\\'s easy to develop a conflict if it doesn\\'t correct accordingly. “ Security risk, hackers can attack, fake transactions, steal information. The risk of cheating and manipulating the market. If not well - controlled, it may appear that “the price of the head can be used for“ the price of the head, ” or “the price of the head, ” or “the price of the head. ” Highly developed costs of high-investigating technology, lowering data, human rights training. The difficulty with the value of each property has its own character, cannot be evaluated automatically as a stock. In particular, it takes a combination of management agencies; if the data doesn\\'t communicate, the transaction process is slow, it doesn\\'t work, Mr. DEA. It is difficult to fight tax returns, “Is it not possible to establish a housing exchange center on an electronic environment when there is only an Internet network? Now, we\\'re missing information, data, security mechanisms... Samha Shun, director of the Institute of Resources and Environmentals, shared our views. According to Shun, setting up a center of real estate transactions in an electronic environment that only manages statistics, the position of the province is “the price of government; and trading to fight tax failure, fighting“ the price of the U.S.R. will be very difficult. However, the chief said, if you do it, you should do it in Hanoi and TPHCM first because these two cities have a huge amount of real estate transactions. If you want to test it, you also have to link the public\\'s office to the land registration office and the corporate brokering center to see what the cost of the trade is through the center, and that\\'s when you know if you have a head or not. Meanwhile, Mr. Lightman notices that in order to deliver real estate transactions to a successful digital environment, we need to ensure synchronization of technology, legal and financial ecosystems. Standardized land data across the country, built the electronic land management system. Along with that, establish an official electronic property exchange, connected to a publicized system, taxes, banks. Complete the legal corridor, acknowledge the legal value of the electronic contract, the signature. The blockchain application for storing property information, avoiding fraud, falsifying papers. Besides, we have to develop online payment systems and sign safe funds, merge with banks to support digital mortgages. “ The digital real estate epidemic is a vital trend. However, Vietnam needed a proper development strategy, making sure that technology, legal, and local markets were properly developed. Need to learn from successful models of countries like Estonia, Dubai and avoid the mistakes of failing markets,\" warned Commander. According to this expert, there has to be a test phase, possibly a test point in Hanoi, TPHCM before expanding. Invest in security technology, blockchain app, AI to secure trade.

Palm Heights project at TP. German heads - Photo: Top of Data from Batdongsan. com. And yet, real estate prices in big cities, especially apartments, over the last five years, have had a significant increase. In particular, in Hanoi, the cost of a condo in the Haomes Smart City project in Long biên and Times City District has increased by 2,850 and 127 percent after five years. In TPHCM, the increase in projects has been considered to be “older than in Hanoi. One of the projects in the central area, Hado Russa Garden (0.10), noted the cost of apartments rising nearly 48 percent after five years; Alexomes Central Park, which is off the edge of the T.C.A. County, increased nearly 53 percent; further from the center of the city, the cost of apartments at Palm Heights project in TP. German heads also have nearly 53% increase. Looking at the increase, some people say, buy real estate before the market goes up, beyond what the buyer can afford. According to expert Ding Shikun, the housing market in Vietnam has been going through 30 years from locality, incomplete laws, and even if it does not encourage land investments, so far so far, that investors can “get as far off as the TPHCM people buy land in DaVA, the people who buy their land. Second, the state is moving more and more real estate into the market economy, through the issue of extended laws, allowing people to own real estate. So now, real estate is a market economy, not a special industry, which is represented by two very severe recessions. The first is 2010-2011. At that time, many businesses failed, and some banks also went bankrupt. By 2022, many banks and businesses had difficulty. This shows that the Vietnam real estate market, although unique, is still operating according to the common rules of the global market. He shows that there's no real-estate market purchases just for words, there's only increases, but it's not down, because it's not the market economy. “ The market economy doesn’t always go up. Instead, once the rise is too fast, there'll be bubbles and closes. The world has been and there are many grisly bubbles - protagonists. With the growing expansion of the Vietnamese real estate market, which is more and more market economic, the question is why the current real estate market is so depressed, it's very difficult for real estate prices to keep going up? If, according to market economic laws, when an investment product increases prices, it shows a lot of demand and is willing to buy; but why is it that the buyers don't get it or it's very difficult to sell, the bank goes on forever? If the real estate market is increasing and continues to increase, proving that the market is so productive, the businesses in the business have no worries about paying their debts, no need for the State to rescue them. “ The real - estate market doesn’t go up as hot as the rumors about how many news media reports are that the buyers are not buying, that they can’t buy at present, that he can’t buy them, that they are small cases, whereas the real estate market is very broad, such as TPHCM or Hanoi. Regarding the story of whether to buy real estate now, Mr. Clear, if the investor is not a very wealthy person, there is a need for closer observation, especially if he should not rush at hot spots such as East Britain or TP. German heads (TPHCM) at a price of 100 million dollars per m2. “ An investor should buy it only when the market is afraid, when the price is low, but not because the price is high and the price is high, especially in a situation that is not as obvious as it is today. He pointed out that if a buyer buys a house to live in, he needs to ask why it is necessary to buy large projects far away, and the price can be up to 70 to 80 million per meter or more. Get an application for the TPHCM districts, the U.S.P.P.P.P.P.P.D., where there's a lot of good housing, comfortable, exciting housing, because it's right at the center; some of the top apartments are being sold at about 70 meters. Five and a half billion dollars at the top of the line, which is over 65 million per meter. Besides the price, the buyer can completely check, evaluate before deciding whether to lower the money, such as observing good management, good habitats, whether to rent it back. So why is it that when the buyers go into new projects, when they hear the real estate information that's scarce, it's not hard to search the Internet for information about many apartments that are being sold at a reasonable price, most apartments now only work for five to seven years and have a good position? These things just show up at the housing market, not to mention other markets like alleys and surrounding land, which show that real estate markets don't heat up like rumors. True buyers can freely find a place with a reasonable price, a discerning expert. On the other hand, during the rising market periods, the majority had the appearance of surfers. Some statistics: up to 70 percent of the investors now have the primary purpose of surfing. Thus, the number of people who really buy to stay is not much. There's not much to worry about. There's a raise in demand. The next surfer won't be able to buy and sell for a few months, so he won't worry about the surfers getting their hands down. Unable to take its own case, the special apartment to talk about market-wide prices, as he shows it, is coming up, Vietnam is coming up, real estate markets are getting bigger and bigger, government policy is getting clearer. Then the real estate market will be like the developed world, becoming the market economy. So there's no higher price than being able to exploit real estate or income. As the countries grow, that's what Vietnam will be like. The value of real estate has come to an end. Can't take personal cases, a special apartment that offers price in the sky to talk about the market economy. Markets in developed cities like New York, Hong Kong, Singapore, Shanghai... all have apartments at a rate of tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars, but that's not why taking those apartments is typical of these cities, because they're unique apartments for super rich people. And the general market of countries has to be based on the income of the people and the level of mining. Neither will Vietnam, nor will housing prices go up regardless of these two factors, he has the evaluation. About the lack of resources, it's easy to find on the Internet information that's selling the second-grade real estate from the street, the infrastructure, the apartment... a lot of it. Besides, just getting out of the city, with every mile out of the city, there's as much open ground as there's open ground, as in the Argentine, the Main Chief, the Republic, the River, the Need for Juju... that shows that there's no shortage of land to build real estate, which leads to a lack of supply.

However, the dream of settling here is a long way off, top income is hard to keep up with. The surveys of Qandme Market Research on February 25 show that home income in TPHCM and Hanoi are superior to other provinces, other cities. The income rate from 40 million to up at TPHCM and Hanoi is four percent, whereas elsewhere, one percent, the rural area is 4.5 percent. The income of 25 million dollars is 45 percent, and in other provinces, 20 percent. And the income goes from 30 million dollars a month to 30 percent, in other provinces of 8%. The income gap between urban and rural areas is enormous. Only 0.7 percent of households in TPHCM and Hanoi have less than 10 million dollars a month than 2.2 percent in rural areas. The data was collected through interviews on a national scale, thus showing a clear disparity that was influenced by the speed of economic growth, job opportunities, and industrial concentration. Hanoi and TPHCM have four percent of their monthly income from 40 million to more. Source: The income painting shows the rich and poor distribution of areas. TPHCM has the highest income, followed by Hanoi and Da Nang. According to surveys, 15,5% of the houses at TPHCM have 35 to 39,9 million dollars a month, compared with 116 in Hanoi and only 1.8 percent in Da Nang. In addition, 5,850 households in TPHCM have income from 40 million to more, while this ratio in Hanoi is 1,8%, and at Da NBA is only 4.5 percent. Although families in TPHCM and Hanoi have the highest income in the country, life is not easy for homes who don't own their homes or are buying their home. The dream of residence and the cost of buying a house was very difficult because housing prices grew at a rapid rate in the last decade. Right now in Hanoi, it's worth about four billion dollars. So the richest household group in Hanoi with 2% of it is worth 40 million dollars a month, if you don't eat anything, it'll take over eight years to buy it. According to Savills, the family income in Hanoi is about 250 million a year. Thus, it took about 16 years for an apartment “to be spread out. Compare the income of three cities. Sources: QM, in fact, costs at TPHCM and Hanoi are much higher than other towns. Let's say the family income is in the highest group and it's 40 million dollars a month. The savings rate may vary depending on the expenses of each family. Let's say that savings are high, let's say 50 percent income, or 20 million dollars a month. It took them almost 17 years to get an apartment. However, that's not counting inflation at high prices and fast housing prices. It's impossible to accumulate money in order to buy a house, realizing a dream of security. The solution is often to borrow and pay. But if you have to borrow a bank, interest will increase the cost of your home and extend the payment of your debt. Time can go back decades if income doesn't break. For the most popular income family group at TPHCM and Hanoi is from 20-24,9 million per month (0.6% of all households), the time accumulates to be able to buy a house or to buy a house will be twice as much as the first group, maybe 40 to 50 years. Compared to rural areas. Sources: QM has a huge income difference between urban and rural areas that are also taking place in many countries in the area and in Asia. In China, although the wealthiest group’s income is higher, real estate prices in large cities, such as Beijing or Shanghai, are far more expensive than TPHCM and Hanoi. Thus, the time for building up houses in these cities can be equal or even longer than Hanoi and TPHCM. As far as the highest income group can be seen, ownership of home in Hanoi and TPHCM has proved to be a major challenge for many households. The difference between the rate of income and the cost of real estate is creating an increasing gap, requiring solutions from both government and market to help people approach their homes more reasonably.

The project is a trade gate in the East Side, connecting the TP. HCM, D.C.A. and Editor. The project was launched in May 2024 and expected to be completed late December 2026, by BQL as an investment in Pacific transport construction. The center connects the three cities of Heracleo to the XL1 bid, which is about two lengths of New York. Four kilometers with three-story design and five bridges. The project is directly linked to six major traffic routes in the east area: Hanoi Highway, Metro 1, 3rd Line, 440 743 A. (D.), 440 743A. In it, the Hanoi Highway (now Wudan Road) plays the role of TP\\'s most important cross - minded axis.

The New NlM and 3rd Wired Line map, whereas the Third Light Street is a strategic communication line, a direct link to the TP. HCM, Editor, and D.C.A., form a complete supply that will enhance the trade and economic development of the East. This line reduces pressure on domestic transportation routes and opens the lobby between industrial areas, urban areas and the logistics center. The fact that the New Earth\\'s intersection is at the intersection of the X-axis between the Hanoi Highway and the 3rd region interconnection and the blood glands shows that this is a rare contoural node that assembles both the elements: the inner urban link and the zone link.

On the other hand, projects along the 3rd floor, but far from the intersection node, have to depend on the branches, make time travel last and reduce its convenientness. Second, the position at the intersection helps projects to benefit from bitter trade activity, especially in the gateway area between the TP. HCM, Pacific and Nai Plain. With high levels of transportation, the projects here have greater commercial potential, which is good for developing retail services, businesses, renting and long-term investments. Meanwhile, far-off projects often have lower commercial skills, due to traffic travel less than the center of traffic. Third, the infrastructure around the New World delivered button is being completed, with a series of utility facilities like the new East Station, the high-tech district, the Aeon Mall, the German University of Majority. This enhances the quality of life and the ability to harness real estate values. Meanwhile, projects far away from the intersections often have to wait a long time for the infrastructure to grow, affecting the potential for increased value.

In order to be transparent, we need to connect with the public record system, the taxes, the bank. In the planning of the Prime Minister\\'s request for price-adjustment, real estate capital, and social drive, the Building Department says that, in the second quarter, it will coordinate with Justice, Finance, Resource and Environment to study the stock trade model in exchange for land procedures. People can trade real estate, notary, tax, and register trades in electronic environments. At the same time, research proposes a pilot project that models the real estate exchange center and the rights to use land run by the State to do research in the II/2025 quarter to increase public, transparency for the market. In order to do these things, experts say, real estate transactions are much more complex than shared stock with journalists, Mr. Lightman, CEO of Financial Sciences, University of Arboring, or, in principle, real estate transactions can be digital, but they can\\'t operate in a stock-like way. The reason Hu put it up, real estate transactions have more specifics, such as high trading values, legal, planning, value and finance than stock. “ Low amounts are due to a long - term transfer of real estate, involving various agencies. Every real estate has its own character, cannot standardize and trade mass like stock. The current legal treatment has not yet been authorized to trade completely on a digital basis without direct confirmation from the public authorities, taxes, environmental resources. The market psychology is afraid, especially with the property trade as large as the property, the buyer still wants to check the facts before the transpo transaction, Mr. Huy. According to experts, setting up a center of real estate transactions if not strictly controlled, there may still be “a price price, a head. Photo: According to experts, there are a lot of barriers and risks in developing online real estate transactions. It\\'s a legal risk when the existing law is not in sync, and it\\'s easy to develop a conflict if it doesn\\'t correct accordingly. “ Security risk, hackers can attack, fake transactions, steal information. The risk of cheating and manipulating the market. If not well - controlled, it may appear that “the price of the head can be used for“ the price of the head, ” or “the price of the head, ” or “the price of the head. ” Highly developed costs of high-investigating technology, lowering data, human rights training. The difficulty with the value of each property has its own character, cannot be evaluated automatically as a stock. In particular, it takes a combination of management agencies; if the data doesn\\'t communicate, the transaction process is slow, it doesn\\'t work, Mr. DEA. It is difficult to fight tax returns, “Is it not possible to establish a housing exchange center on an electronic environment when there is only an Internet network? Now, we\\'re missing information, data, security mechanisms... Samha Shun, director of the Institute of Resources and Environmentals, shared our views. According to Shun, setting up a center of real estate transactions in an electronic environment that only manages statistics, the position of the province is “the price of government; and trading to fight tax failure, fighting“ the price of the U.S.R. will be very difficult. However, the chief said, if you do it, you should do it in Hanoi and TPHCM first because these two cities have a huge amount of real estate transactions. If you want to test it, you also have to link the public\\'s office to the land registration office and the corporate brokering center to see what the cost of the trade is through the center, and that\\'s when you know if you have a head or not. Meanwhile, Mr. Lightman notices that in order to deliver real estate transactions to a successful digital environment, we need to ensure synchronization of technology, legal and financial ecosystems. Standardized land data across the country, built the electronic land management system. Along with that, establish an official electronic property exchange, connected to a publicized system, taxes, banks. Complete the legal corridor, acknowledge the legal value of the electronic contract, the signature. The blockchain application for storing property information, avoiding fraud, falsifying papers. Besides, we have to develop online payment systems and sign safe funds, merge with banks to support digital mortgages. “ The digital real estate epidemic is a vital trend. However, Vietnam needed a proper development strategy, making sure that technology, legal, and local markets were properly developed. Need to learn from successful models of countries like Estonia, Dubai and avoid the mistakes of failing markets,\" warned Commander. According to this expert, there has to be a test phase, possibly a test point in Hanoi, TPHCM before expanding. Invest in security technology, blockchain app, AI to secure trade. At the same time, build a legal corridor, create trust for the people. \"If we make the right route, our model of real estate transactions in the digital environment can help to increase transparency, reduce risk, and stimulate terms for the Vietnam real estate market in the future, Mr. Halley will share more.

Palm Heights project at TP. German heads - Photo: Top of Data from Batdongsan. com. And yet, real estate prices in big cities, especially apartments, over the last five years, have had a significant increase. In particular, in Hanoi, the cost of a condo in the Haomes Smart City project in Long biên and Times City District has increased by 2,850 and 127 percent after five years. In TPHCM, the increase in projects has been considered to be “older than in Hanoi. One of the projects in the central area, Hado Russa Garden (0.10), noted the cost of apartments rising nearly 48 percent after five years; Alexomes Central Park, which is off the edge of the T.C.A. County, increased nearly 53 percent; further from the center of the city, the cost of apartments at Palm Heights project in TP. German heads also have nearly 53% increase. Looking at the increase, some people say, buy real estate before the market goes up, beyond what the buyer can afford. According to expert Ding Shikun, the housing market in Vietnam has been going through 30 years from locality, incomplete laws, and even if it does not encourage land investments, so far so far, that investors can “get as far off as the TPHCM people buy land in DaVA, the people who buy their land. Second, the state is moving more and more real estate into the market economy, through the issue of extended laws, allowing people to own real estate. So now, real estate is a market economy, not a special industry, which is represented by two very severe recessions. The first is 2010-2011. At that time, many businesses failed, and some banks also went bankrupt. By 2022, many banks and businesses had difficulty. This shows that the Vietnam real estate market, although unique, is still operating according to the common rules of the global market. He shows that there's no real-estate market purchases just for words, there's only increases, but it's not down, because it's not the market economy. “ The market economy doesn’t always go up. Instead, once the rise is too fast, there'll be bubbles and closes. The world has been and there are many grisly bubbles - protagonists. With the growing expansion of the Vietnamese real estate market, which is more and more market economic, the question is why the current real estate market is so depressed, it's very difficult for real estate prices to keep going up? If, according to market economic laws, when an investment product increases prices, it shows a lot of demand and is willing to buy; but why is it that the buyers don't get it or it's very difficult to sell, the bank goes on forever? If the real estate market is increasing and continues to increase, proving that the market is so productive, the businesses in the business have no worries about paying their debts, no need for the State to rescue them. “ The real - estate market doesn’t go up as hot as the rumors about how many news media reports are that the buyers are not buying, that they can’t buy at present, that he can’t buy them, that they are small cases, whereas the real estate market is very broad, such as TPHCM or Hanoi. Regarding the story of whether to buy real estate now, Mr. Clear, if the investor is not a very wealthy person, there is a need for closer observation, especially if he should not rush at hot spots such as East Britain or TP. German heads (TPHCM) at a price of 100 million dollars per m2. “ An investor should buy it only when the market is afraid, when the price is low, but not because the price is high and the price is high, especially in a situation that is not as obvious as it is today. He pointed out that if a buyer buys a house to live in, he needs to ask why it is necessary to buy large projects far away, and the price can be up to 70 to 80 million per meter or more. Get an application for the TPHCM districts, the U.S.P.P.P.P.P.P.D., where there's a lot of good housing, comfortable, exciting housing, because it's right at the center; some of the top apartments are being sold at about 70 meters. Five and a half billion dollars at the top of the line, which is over 65 million per meter. Besides the price, the buyer can completely check, evaluate before deciding whether to lower the money, such as observing good management, good habitats, whether to rent it back. So why is it that when the buyers go into new projects, when they hear the real estate information that's scarce, it's not hard to search the Internet for information about many apartments that are being sold at a reasonable price, most apartments now only work for five to seven years and have a good position? These things just show up at the housing market, not to mention other markets like alleys and surrounding land, which show that real estate markets don't heat up like rumors. True buyers can freely find a place with a reasonable price, a discerning expert. On the other hand, during the rising market periods, the majority had the appearance of surfers. Some statistics: up to 70 percent of the investors now have the primary purpose of surfing. Thus, the number of people who really buy to stay is not much. There's not much to worry about. There's a raise in demand. The next surfer won't be able to buy and sell for a few months, so he won't worry about the surfers getting their hands down. Unable to take its own case, the special apartment to talk about market-wide prices, as he shows it, is coming up, Vietnam is coming up, real estate markets are getting bigger and bigger, government policy is getting clearer. Then the real estate market will be like the developed world, becoming the market economy. So there's no higher price than being able to exploit real estate or income. As the countries grow, that's what Vietnam will be like. The value of real estate has come to an end. Can't take personal cases, a special apartment that offers price in the sky to talk about the market economy. Markets in developed cities like New York, Hong Kong, Singapore, Shanghai... all have apartments at a rate of tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars, but that's not why taking those apartments is typical of these cities, because they're unique apartments for super rich people. And the general market of countries has to be based on the income of the people and the level of mining. Neither will Vietnam, nor will housing prices go up regardless of these two factors, he has the evaluation. About the lack of resources, it's easy to find on the Internet information that's selling the second-grade real estate from the street, the infrastructure, the apartment... a lot of it. Besides, just getting out of the city, with every mile out of the city, there's as much open ground as there's open ground, as in the Argentine, the Main Chief, the Republic, the River, the Need for Juju... that shows that there's no shortage of land to build real estate, which leads to a lack of supply.

The cost of the digital economy is 50 percent minimum, creating a solid foundation for sustainable economic growth, turning the capital into the gravitational point of high-tech businesses. I\\'m interested in Hanoi\\'s Action Program, according to Dr. Army, the Minister of Science and Technology, the city needs to specificize its targets and identify the breakthroughs. In it, we have to choose the dominant products of technology science, select some serious technology products where the city is powerful, such as the micro circuit, the AI chip... that can choose some units to test, if it succeeds, expands that model to other units. In particular, Hanoi needs to take advantage of the Prime Minister\\'s Rule to be a controlled test center. PGS. Dr. Moffat won, director of the University of Intellectual Sciences, to grow two sustainable, creative numbers, and start a very important career, and start with the creative products of the students.
